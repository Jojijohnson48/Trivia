Trivia App:

This is a basic android app which is similar to any other quiz app, having some questions and correct answers to it. This app touches various concepts such as networking, fetching the data using an API and parsing the Json data, interface callback, saving the data onto the disk(making a data persist) and Android Animations. It uses volley library for implementing a RequestQueue which fetches the data from the provided URL, and uses Shared Preferences for making the score as a persist data so that each time when the activity gets destroyed, the last highest score made by the player retains. If the player stops playing the quiz and leave the app in between, then once player comes back, the app starts from the instance where it was left.
